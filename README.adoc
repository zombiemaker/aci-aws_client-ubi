= AWS Client Tools On UBI

This is a container image that supplies a set of software tools that enables application developers and AWS system operators to interact with AWS without having to install the tools on their local workstation computers.

== Components included:

* [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)
* [AWS eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html)
* [Kubernetes kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-linux)
* Terraform
* Kubernetes Operations (kops)
* Python38
* git
* jq
* yq
* curl
* wget
* tar
* unzip

# Process

* Change to a directory where you want to store your programs
* Start the container mounting the current directory to /home/me container directory
+
----
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/me <image-repo>:<image-tag>
----
+
By starting the container in this manner, all programs and data you create within the container will be stored in the current directory from where you created the container.
* Test the following programs:
+
----
aws version
eksctl version
kubectl version
terraform version
kops version
----

* Configure the AWS client
+
----
aws configure
----

* Enter your AWS IAM credentials
* Enter your default region name (e.g., us-east-2)
* Enter default output format (e.g., json)

The following actions require that the AWS IAM user that you are using has suitable IAM authorizations to perform the actions.

* Check to see if you are able to connect to AWS
+
----
aws iam get-user
aws sts get-caller-identity
